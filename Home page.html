Skibidi Toilet
All EpisodesThe Skibidi Toilet are the titular main antagonists of the Skibidi Toilet series, created by DaFuq!?Boom! and are the primary adversaries of The Alliance. These beings are predominantly designed as toilets, each with chanting heads protruding from their toilet bowls, which often serve as their method of attack. They are responsible for numerous acts of aggression towards both their enemies and innocent bystanders, as well as spreading the influence of the Parasitic Skibidi Toilet, which can also serve as their primary minions.

Description
Each Skibidi Toilets appearance can radically deviate from convention, yet the overwhelming majority of them tend to look like a typical white ceramic flush toilet with a human head extending from the bowl through a lengthy, flesh-colored neck. These heads are able to stretch out at least several feet, twisting and bending in any direction. Skibidi Toilet expressions often seem highly exaggerated, with enormous, manic eyes and often an unnaturally broad, elongated grin. The majority of Skibidi Toilet sport two handles: a traditional pull-down handle on the front portion of the tank and a pull-up handle on the topmost region.

Despite these similarities, variations of Skibidi Toilet differ in numerous ways, not including any adjustments to the clothing they donate and the weaponry they carry. Some may even possess a bathtub or urinal, have multiple heads mounted on their necks, be developed from distinct fixtures, boast alternative colors (like dark gray) and/or possess unique dimensions ranging from tiny to colossal (with some reaching the height of a towering skyscraper). Their overwhelming presence on battlegrounds can be felt by all, accompanied by the sound of the Anthem, which many sing with unswerving zeal.

Toilet Sizes
Skibidi Toilet' sizes can be classified into 12 categories:

Size	Typical size compared to Normal
Nano (e.g. Parasite Toilets)	0.3
Small	0.5
Normal	1
Medium	2
Semi-Large/Tall	2.5
Large	5
Very Large	10
Semi Giant	15
Giant	16
Titan (G-Man Skibidi Toilet,
Airborne Giant Rocket Skibidi Toilet, Malformed Strider Skibidi Toilet, etc)

80-120
Mega Titan (Upgraded Scientist Skibidi Toilet)	140-160
Communication
All of the Skibidi Toilet verbal "communication" is formed from the opening lyrics of the song "Skibidi Toilet" or snippets of those opening lyrics. The song is a sped-up remix/mashup of the songs "Give It To Me" by Timbaland (The most common and popular one), "Promiscuous" by Nelly Furtado and "Dom Dom Yes Yes" by Biser King. They are shown to repeat the opening lyrics in full and in short snippets, indicating that it serves as a form of speech as well as their battle cry. Usually, the larger the variant of Skibidi Toilet, the slower, deeper and more bellowing their singing is.

Analysis
Movement
Skibidi Toilet have been shown to move in a wide variety of ways. This variety is greatest among the more elite members of their army. The most common way they transport is by sliding normally across the floor.

Movement Method	Description	Examples
Violates
Physics

Gliding	The default and only option for most Skibidi Toilet. Almost all Toilets lack legs, wheels, or any other form of locomotion. Instead, they can glide across the ground, and may do so at high speeds.
This gliding somehow does not usually generate friction, with neither the bottom of the toilet nor the traversed ground turning hot.
Normal Skibidi Toilet, Medium Skibidi Toilet, Large Skibidi Toilet, Giant Skibidi Toilet, Vacuum Skibidi Urinal, Triple Giant Skibidi Toilet, Triple Skibidi Bathtub
Flight via unknown methods	Performed without obvious modifications.	Normal Flying Skibidi Toilet, Giant Flying Skibidi Toilet, Glitch Skibidi Toilet, Astro Toilets
Flight using rockets	These are used either for ballistic propulsion, usually for the sake of ramming, or for general aerodynamic flight.
In Skibidi toilet 20, the Giant Rocket Skibidi Toilet unphysically rams into Titan Cameraman mid-air while his rockets are pointing horizontally. The reason why he does not fall to the ground is unknown.
Giant Rocket Skibidi Toilet
Flight using jetpacks	Jetpacks are attached on the back of the toilets, allowing them to fly
Jetpacks of all jetpack toilets points slightly to the front to 'allow flight', but in real life the toilets will spin out of control.
Jetpack Skibidi Toilet, Flying Dual Buzzsaw Skibidi Toilet, Flying Quad-Launcher Skibidi Toilet, G-Man Skibidi Toilet
Flight using blades	Like helicopters in real life, this allows the toilets to fly.
Physically, if the blades spin clockwise, the toilet will spin anticlockwise. Vice versa if the blades are spinning anticlockwise.
Helicopter Skibidi Toilet, Helicopter Strider Skibidi Toilet
Limbs	Usually either long spider-like legs resembling those of the Strider from Half Life 2 or crab-like limbs.	Strider Skibidi Toilet, Parasitic Skibidi Toilet, Hydra Strider Skibidi Toilet, Malformed Strider Skibidi Toilet
Teleportation	Simple fading in and out, similar to TV Men but faster.	Giant Skull Skibidi Toilet, Scientist Skibidi Toilet(probably)
Wheels	Usually either rubber tire/plastic, excavator wheels or tank tracks. Allows them to move at high speeds and may simultaneously crush everything on their path.	Dual Buzzsaw Car Skibidi Toilet, Dual Laser Launcher Skibidi Toilet, Claw Skibidi Toilet, Giant Blind Flamethrower Skibidi Toilet

Durability and weaknesses
Skibidi Toilets are also surprisingly durable, able to resist being struck by heavy blunt objects and even most bullets short of anti-vehicle rounds. However, they are still far from invincible, as seen when Cameramen threw Skibidi Toilets off a highway and the thrown toilets promptly exploded upon impacting the ground in Episode 12. Additionally, an attacker can stun them by striking them hard with a punch, sound waves, or blunt objects.

Killing method	Description	Notes
Flushing	The greatest weakness of most Toilets is the handle on the top of each one's tank - if pulled, any heads extending from the bowl will be "flushed" down that bowl.[1] This renders it immobile, and most likely "dead".	
Destruction	Throwing or smashing Skibidi Toilet.	Method is only used by the Large Cameraman and Titan Cameraman tossing a toilet into a building/something else, maybe even the Large Speakerman.
Strong Sound Waves can throw the Skibidi Toilet back, destroying them by forcing them into buildings or other beings.	Only used by Strider Speaker but May be Also Can Used By Helicopter Speaker.
A direct stomp onto the head of the Skibidi Toilet. However, you must to be larger than the Skibidi Toilet.	Method is used by the Large Cameraman, Maybe the Large Speakerman, and the Titan Cameraman
by TV Men only	Purple Screen of Death	A Powerful Purple Light that hypnotizes the Skibidi Toilet.	only used by Tv Man
Blinding Light	A powerful blazing, white light that will cause the Skibidi Toilet to go blind and become reckless, causing them to crash into objects, buildings, or other beings.	Only Used by Polycephaly
Red Light	A powerful type of Red Light that causes the Skibidi Toilet to go mad and start flushing themselves or their head will explode.	Only used by the Titan TV Man
Orange Light	A powerful Orange Light that can burn the Skibidi Toilet.	Only Used by the TV Woman
Brainwashing	The TV Woman First detached her head and went over to the Skibidi Toilet, latched onto it, then forced it to attack its own allies and ultimately kill itself.	Only Used by the TV Woman
Stabbing	The Cinemaman uses the claws on its back to stab the Skibidi Toilet. This can be used for close-range attacks like stabbing the Vacuum Skibidi toilet or long-range attacks. When he was trying to aim for the Large Parasitic Skibidi toilet that was controlling the Titan Speakerman, it was protected by one of the speakers. In episode 56, a TV Man was seen stabbing a Skibidi toilet using a knife.	Used by Cinemaman and TV Man
Plunging	Forcing Toilets' heads down into their bowls utilizing a plunger.	Used by Jetpack Black Cameraman

Behavior
So far, all Skibidi Toilet show ruthless aggression and violence, swiftly lunging at and attacking anyone they deem a threat with little hesitation or mercy by headbutting or biting their victims. They will only hesitate when proudly repeating their anthem. They are shown to attack in multiple ways, such as biting, ramming, and shooting. Skibidi toilets will usually jumpscare the POV Cameraman at the end of an Episode, like in episodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. At 0:23, triple 11, 12 with the laser (possibly) 13, and 14 with the explosion.

Leading Skibidi Toilets have demonstrated high intelligence. They have strong scientific capabilities, and are sometimes shown working in laboratories led by a single chief scientist. They quickly develop countermeasures to any abilities and technologies The Alliance gains and produces. They also regularly show tactical know-how by baiting and ambushing The Alliance's forces. Skibidi Toilets are knowledgeable beings that use strategy and their overwhelming numbers to bring an apocalypse to The Alliance.

Attacks
Attack method	Description	Users / Notes
Lunging/Biting	In Episode 10, Skibidi Toilets can be seen biting a Cameraman to death. The toilet lunges its head towards the subject's head using its stretchy neck and bites the subject.	Most Skibidi Toilets use this method. They also use it to attack the POV-Cameraman. An example is the Hydra Strider Skibidi Toilet, one that used this attack in an attempt to take down POV-Cameraman.
Ramming	This attack involves a Toilet running over its target.	Mostly executed by the Large Camouflage Skibidi Toilet or the Giant Rocket Skibidi Toilet.
Lasers	Arguably the most powerful of attacks. Involves a laser shooting out of the eyes of the Toilet, or from laser cannons.	Used mostly by the G-Man Skibidi Toilet.
Stabbing	An attack that involves a Skibidi Toilet using one of its arms, claws or legs to stab/impale a Member of The Alliance.

Slashing	Attack performed by Skibidi Toilets with saw blades attached to their arms by spinning them around quickly.	Method only used by Dual Blade Skibidi Toilet and Giant Dual Blade Skibidi Toilet.
Vacuuming	The Vacuum Skibidi Toilet is able to suck members of The Alliance into its mouth. This attack does not kill them instantly.	Method only used by Blind Jetpack Vacuum Skibidi Toilet.
Blasting	The Astro Assailant Toilet has a blaster cannon which he uses to attack (similar to Upgraded Titan Speakerman's blaster cannons, but smaller).	Method only used by Astro Assailant Skibidi Toilet.
Fire	The Giant Blind Flamethrower Skibidi Toilet can breathe fire out of its mouth to burn nearby Alliance members.	Method only used by Giant Blind Flamethrower Skibidi toilet.

Skibidi Toilet Anthem
This sound is played by any Skibidi Toilets nearby, or an infected/controlled Cameraman/Speakerman. Skibidi Toilets pop up their heads from their toilet seat after playing the word ridiculous. The song used is the mashup of Give It To Me by Timbaland (feat. Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake) and Dom Dom Yes Yes by Fiki Chupki V Krista (Original song by Biser King). This anthem actually has a different lyrics where instead it says "What the heck is going on-on youtube-". It was changed this way presumably to avoid getting copyright strikes.

Trivia
The Skibidi Toilet models are a mashup of a toilet and an NPC model from Half-Life 2. Some examples include:Male_07, male_09,etc
The toilet part of the Skibidi Toilets has two handles, one on the front left side of the tank and a pull-handle on top. This is most likely based on a "duel flush" system that allows the user to choose different amounts of water to use for flushing different types of waste in order to help save water.
The Skibidi Toilet Anthem can sometimes be used for a way of speech for the Skibidi Toilets, as shown in Skibidi toilet 17, Skibidi toilet 28 and Skibidi toilet 60.
The very first Skibidi Toilet model appeared much before the series itself, in DaFuqBoom's video MULTIVERSE OF BEATBOX - EPISODE 2: MALE_07 vs MALE_09 (PART 2) where it is shown to be one of the alternate skins of Male_07.</p>
